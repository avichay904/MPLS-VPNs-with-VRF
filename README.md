# MPLS-VPNs-with-VRF
The project is built on MPLS, with OSPF as the underlying protocol. VPNs with VRF are established. Redundancy in the branches is ensured through HSRP and BGP.

# MPLS-based project with OSPF protocol.
# VPNs implemented using VRF.
# HSRP redundancy in the branches.
# BGP utilized for routing.
# Multiple VRF instances (avi, centrex, koko, moshe) with respective route-targets.
# Loopback interfaces and IP addresses configured.
# OSPF and BGP routing configurations.
# MPLS LDP configured with Loopback0as the router ID.
# Control plane configurations, including line console and vty settings.
